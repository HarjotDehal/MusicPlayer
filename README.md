# MusicPlayer


A Music Player built in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses built in functions of Javascript to play music. It has 20 of my favorite songs and it has features such as a time bar, pause button, and next/previous buttons. It also allows you to pick any one of my favorite songs and play them at once.
